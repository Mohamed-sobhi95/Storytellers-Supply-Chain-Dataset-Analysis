## Business Questions to Address

### Revenue & Sales Analysis:
- What is the impact of product type on revenue generated?
- Which SKUs are the most and least profitable?
- How do customer demographics influence product sales?
- What are the trends in order quantities over time?

### Inventory & Logistics Performance:
- What is the relationship between stock levels and lead times?
- Which shipping carriers provide the best balance of cost and speed?
- What are the average shipping costs across different transportation modes (Air, Road, Rail)?
- How do order quantities impact shipping times?

### Supplier & Manufacturing Efficiency:
- Which suppliers have the lowest lead times and manufacturing costs?
- How do defect rates vary across suppliers and product types?
- What is the relationship between production volumes and manufacturing costs?
- Which inspection results show the highest failure rates, and what causes them?

### Forecasting & Optimization:
- Can we predict lead times based on supplier performance and location?
- How can we optimize inventory levels to reduce stockouts and overstocking?
- What factors contribute to higher defect rates, and how can they be minimized?
- How do seasonal trends impact sales and revenue projections?
